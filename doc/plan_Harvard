1. selling points:
	- speckless: sparse (edge) -> dense interpolation
	- real time system
	- analysis

2. TODO:
	- result
	- ref for dynamic DIC




A. Our video measurement is right:
1. Test on simulation video (add noise)
    - [done] lattice
    - [todo] acoustic: need the simulation video
2. Test on a video with driving force F:
    - [done] compare the global shape with simulation result
    - [todo] compare the motion of points with other measurement
3. Test on videos with driving force [0, F/8, F/2]:
    - [done] see how the signal becomes stronger and stronger in the power spectrum



B. Our video measurement is better than Digital Image Correlation (DIC):
1. Theory:
    - feature to match/
    - Gaussian/Cosine shape
    - edge/texture/
2. Simulation:
    - when DIC performs 
3. Experiment:
run DIC on all the videos above and compare the results. I've done a few experiments and we are consistently better than DIC. I'm trying to get some theoretical proof for it.
